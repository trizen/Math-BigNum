Revision history for Math-BigNum

0.06    xxx
        - fixed bpow(0, Inf) to return `0` and bpow(0, -Inf) to return `Inf`
        - added more tests for bpow() and bipow()
        - added the irand() method, which returns a random integer
        - slightly faster stringification of floating-point numbers
