Revision history for Math-BigNum

0.11    2016-xx-xx
        - Added the `$n->parts` method, which returns the numerator and the denominator as BigNum objects.
        - Increased the default accuracy value for the method `is_prime` from 12 to 20.
        - Support for rational exponentiation with an integer power.

            Example:
                (3/5)**3 == 27/125

        - Added the `$x->li` method for computing the logarithm integral of `$x`.
        - Optimized the `$k->root($n)` method for positive integer values of `$n`.
        - Added the `$n->bernreal` method, which returns the nth-Bernoulli number as a floating-point value.
        - Added the `$n->kronecker($k)` method, which returns the Kronecker symbol (n|k).
        - Added the following exportable functions:

                factorial(n)       # product of first n integers: n!
                primorial(n)       # product of primes <= n
                binomial(n,k)      # binomial coefficient
                fibonacci(n)       # nth-Fibonacci number
                lucas(n)           # nth-Lucas number
                ipow(a,k)          # integer exponentiation: int(a^k)

        - Added the method `$n->popcount`, which returns the number of 1s in the binary representation of `$n`.
        - Changed the return values of the `sign` method from ("-", "", "+") to (-1, 0, 1).
        - Added the `:all` option to export anything that is exportable (functions + constants).
        - Added the `$n->valuation($k)` method, which returns the number of times `$n` is divisible by `$k`.
        - Extended the method `float` to accept an optional argument with the number of bits of precision.
        - Added the `$x->bfloat` method, which truncates `$x` in-place to a floating-point value.
        - Added the method `$n->is_pow($k)`, which returns true iff `a^k = n` for some positive integer `a`.
        - Added the following floating-point functions:

                (b)fadd
                (b)fsub
                (b)fmul
                (b)fdiv
                (b)fmod
                (b)fpow

        - Some minor bug-fixes and documentation improvements.

0.10    2016-17-08
        - Faster creation of MPFR objects from scalar integer values.
        - Conversion of scalar values to MPFR objects is done more strictly, by validating each conversion.
        - Added the missing `[b|i]mul` methods in the `Nan` class.
        - Minor overall performance improvements, by taking advantage of some commutative properties.
        - Added the `bln()` method, which calculates the natural logarithm in-place.
        - Stricter definitions for the `log` and `blog` methods when one of the arguments is +/-Infinity.
        - Require Math::GMPz >= 0.39 (for Rmpz_bin_si).
        - Use Math::GMPq's (>=0.41) `_ulong_max()` and `_long_min()` to determine the integer limits.

0.09    2016-15-08
        - Better support for scalar values.
        - Better performance for `idiv()` and `bidiv()` when called with negative scalar integers.
        - Faster creation of Math::BigNum objects with scalar integer values.
        - Scalar values passed to `(b)i*` methods are now validated or converted correspondingly.

0.08    2016-13-08
        - Added support for `+inf`, `-inf` and `nan`, each represented as a scalar value.
        - Improved the support for infinity to work with any numerical object and any special scalar values.

0.07    2016-06-08
        - Fixed a critical bug in the stringification of very small floating-point values
