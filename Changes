Revision history for Math-BigNum

0.16    2016-xx-xx

        [ADDED]

        - Added two methods for computing the nth-Harmonic number:

            + harmfrac(n)
            + harmreal(n)

        - Added two methods for reseeding the pseudorandom number generator:

            + seed(n)
            + iseed(n)

        [IMPROVEMENTS]

        - Extended the method digits() to accept an optional base.

            + digits(4095, 16)  #=> ('f', 'f', 'f')

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Using threads in some parts of the program, will no longer cause a segmentation fault.

        However, Math::BigNum is not thread-safe, therefore using Math::BigNum objects inside threads, still causes a segmentation fault.

        [ADDED]

        - Unimport support.

            no Math::BigNum;     # disables the `:constant` behavior in the current scope

        - Added the `new_int()` and `new_uint()` methods for setting signed and unsigned native integers.

        [PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS]

        - Noticeable optimizations in method `is_pow`. (Thanks to Dana Jacobsen)
        - Minor optimization in `bernfrac()` for values of n < 50.
        - Faster algorithm in `bernfrac()` for values of `n` >= 50. (based on the Zeta function)
        - Faster algorithm in `bernreal()`, using positive values of the Zeta function. (before, negative values were used)

        [BUG FIXES]

        - When a base is specified, special values, such "Inf" and "NaN", are no longer parsed specially.

            + Math::BigNum->new('inf', 36) == 24171
            + Math::BigNum->new('nan', 36) == 30191

                + primorial(n)       # product of primes <= n
                + binomial(n,k)      # binomial coefficient
                + fibonacci(n)       # nth-Fibonacci number
                + lucas(n)           # nth-Lucas number
                + ipow(a,k)          # integer exponentiation: a^k

        - Added the method `$n->popcount`, which returns the number of 1s in the binary representation of `$n`.
        - Changed the return values of the `sign` method from ("-", "", "+") to (-1, 0, 1).
        - Added the `:all` option to export anything that is exportable (functions + constants).
        - Added the `$n->valuation($k)` method, which returns the number of times `$n` is divisible by `$k`.
        - Extended the method `float` to accept an optional argument with the number of bits of precision.
        - Added the `$x->bfloat` method, which truncates `$x` in-place to a floating-point value.

        - Added the method `$x->lgrt`, which returns the logarithmic-root of `$x`.
