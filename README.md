# Math-BigNum

Transparent interface to Math::GMPq, Math::GMPz, Math::MPFR and Math::MPC

# DESCRIPTION

Math::BigNum provides a correct, intuitive and transparent interface to the GMP, MPFR and MPC numerical libraries.

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use 5.014;
use Math::BigNum qw(:constant);

# Big numbers
say ((100->fac + 1) / 2);
  # => 466631077219720763408496194281333502453579841321908107 \
  #    342964819476087999966149578044707319880782591431268489 \
  #    60413611879125592605458432000000000000000000000000.5

# Small numbers
say sqrt(1 / 100->fac);     # => 1.0351378111756264713204945916572e-79

# Rational numbers
my $x = 2/3;
say $x*3;                   # => 2
say 2/$x;                   # => 3

# Floating-point numbers
say "equal" if (1.1 + 2.2 == 3.3);     # => "equal"

# Complex numbers
say sqrt(-1);               # => i
```

Importing the `i` constant to explicitly create complex numbers:

```perl
use Math::BigNum qw(:constant i);

my $z = 3 + 4*i;
say $z;              # => "3+4i"
say $z + 2;          # => "5+4i"
say sqrt($z);        # => "2+i"
```
